      <p>
        This Shipping Policy applies to all digital products and services
        offered through our website. Since we do not sell any physical goods,
        there is no traditional shipping involved.

      <h2>Delivery Method</h2>
      <p>
        All purchases are delivered electronically. After your payment is
        successfully processed and confirmed, you will receive an automated
        email with your access details, download link, or instructions to
        retrieve your product from your account dashboard on our website.

      <h2>Delivery Timeframe</h2>
      <p>
        In most cases, digital deliveries are completed instantly. However, in
        rare cases (such as payment verification delays or system maintenance),
        delivery may take up to 24 hours. If you have not received your product
        within this time, please contact us immediately.
      </p>
      <h2>Incorrect Email Address</h2>
      <p>
        We are not responsible for delays in delivery caused by an incorrect or
        incomplete email address provided during checkout. Please ensure that
        your contact details are accurate before completing your purchase.
      </p>
